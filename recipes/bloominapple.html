    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Say hello to the Bloomin’ Apple—a sweet fall spin on the classic restaurant favorite. This fun, interactive dessert transforms a Honeycrisp apple into a show-stopping treat that’s “soooo good and flavorful!” according to our recipe testers.Unlike the Bloomin’ Onion, this dish isn’t deep-fried. Instead, we brush each apple petal with buttery apple pie spice, then bake them until they’re perfectly tender and syrupy-sweet. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and you’ve got a cozy, crowd-pleasing dessert that’s as easy as it is impressive.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large (9 ounce) Honeycrisp apples</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons apple pie spice blend</li>
        <li>8 medium soft caramel squares (such as Werther's)</li>
        <li>vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>caramel sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Slice off the top 1/2-inch of each apple. Using an apple corer, a melon baller, or a teaspoon, remove core, starting at the top of each apple and stopping about 1 inch from the bottom of the apple.</li>
        <li> Using a paring knife or a round cookie cutter, cut 2 concentric circles 1/4-inch apart outward from core, cutting as deep as possible without cutting all the way through bottom of apple.</li>
        <li> Working from the top of the apple, cut vertically into 8 equal slices, leaving apple intact 1/2-inch from bottom.</li>
        <li> In a small bowl, whisk together butter, brown sugar, and apple pie spice until well combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li> Place apples in an 8-inch square baking dish. Fill each apple with two caramel squares. Brush butter mixture evenly over the tops of each apple. Pour boiling water around the apples to a depth of 1/4-inch in the bottom of the dish. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake, uncovered, until sugar begins to caramelize and apples are tender when pierced with a paring knife, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Allow apples to cool for 10 minutes. Using your hands, gently spread apple “petals” apart. Serve warm or at room temperature topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce.</li>
    </ol>
